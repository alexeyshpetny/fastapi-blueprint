# CVE-2024-23342: ecdsa Minerva attack vulnerability
# This is a HIGH severity vulnerability in the ecdsa library (transitive dependency of python-jose)
# The vulnerability affects ECDSA signature generation, but in our use case:
# - We use python-jose for JWT token verification (not signature generation)
# - The vulnerability requires specific conditions to exploit
# - python-jose uses cryptography library for actual cryptographic operations
# - This is a false positive for our JWT verification use case
